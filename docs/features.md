### Comparison with Similar Projects

| Feature | Bookmarker PWA | Similar Project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Note Management | Local storage, tagging system | External note-taking apps like Evernote or OneNote |
| Task Creation | Built-in task creation feature | Integration with existing calendar apps like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar |
| Cross-Platform Compatibility | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript | Native mobile app development using platform-specific languages |

The Bookmarker PWA offers a unique blend of note-taking and task management features, making it an attractive alternative to traditional external note-taking apps.

### Use Cases

*   **Personal Note-Taker**: Individuals can use the Bookmarker PWA as a personal note-taker for storing ideas, research notes, or daily journal entries.
*   **Task Management**: Users with multiple tasks and deadlines can leverage the application's task creation feature to stay organized and on track.

Example Use Case:

Suppose you're a student looking to organize your course materials and assignments. You create new notes for each topic, tagging them with relevant keywords (e.g., "mathematics," "physics"). You then use the task management feature to schedule due dates for assignments and set reminders to ensure timely completion.

### Limitations

*   **No Offline Sync**: The application requires a stable internet connection to sync data across devices. Offline access is available, but notes and tasks may not be updated automatically.
*   **Limited Collaboration Features**: While users can assign tasks and due dates, there's no built-in collaboration feature for real-time co-editing or commenting.

### Roadmap and Future Features

#### Short-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

*   Implement offline sync using WebSockets and a local cache.
*   Introduce basic collaboration features (e.g., task assignment, due date notifications).

#### Mid-Term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)

*   Develop advanced collaboration tools (e.g., real-time co-editing, commenting).
*   Expand the tagging system to support more complex filtering and sorting.

#### Long-Term Goals (Next 1-2 Years)

*   Introduce artificial intelligence-powered suggestions for note organization and task prioritization.
*   Explore integration with popular productivity apps (e.g., Todoist, RescueTime).

By focusing on these features and milestones, the Bookmarker PWA aims to become a go-to tool for individuals seeking a comprehensive note-taking and task management solution.
