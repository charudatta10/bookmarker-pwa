### Common Installation Issues

#### .yml File Not Found

If you encounter an error stating that the `.yml` file is not found, ensure that it is located in the root directory of your project at `C:\Users\korde\Home\Github\bookmarker-pwa`.

```bash
cd C:\Users\korde\Home\Github\bookmarker-pwa
```

Verify that the file exists by running the following command:

```bash
ls
```

If the file is missing, you can recreate it from the `archive.md` file or download a fresh copy from the project's GitHub repository.

#### Missing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
yarn install
```

These commands will ensure that all required packages are installed.
