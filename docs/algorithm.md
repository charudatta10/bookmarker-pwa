### Key Algorithms Implemented

The Bookmarker PWA employs several key algorithms to ensure efficient and secure data processing. The following are some of the notable ones:

*   **Hashing Algorithms**
    *   **MD5**: Used for generating a fixed-size hash value from input data, suitable for data integrity checks.
    *   **SHA-256**: Employed for cryptographic purposes, such as password storage and verification.
*   **Data Structure**
    *   **Hash Table**: Utilized for efficient data retrieval and storage, providing an average time complexity of O(1) for search operations.
*   **Algorithm for Data Validation**
    *   **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Used to validate user input against a set of predefined patterns, ensuring the integrity of the entered data.

### Mathematical Foundations

The algorithms used in this project are grounded in fundamental mathematical concepts:

*   **Number Theory**: The hashing algorithms utilize number theory principles to ensure secure and deterministic data transformations.
*   **Data Structures**: The hash table's performance relies on an understanding of discrete mathematics, particularly graph theory and combinatorics.

### Performance Characteristics

The chosen algorithms provide the following performance characteristics:

| Algorithm            | Average Time Complexity | Space Complexity         |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Hashing Algorithms    | O(1)                    | O(n)                     |
| Data Structure        | O(1)                    | O(n)                     |

### Optimization Techniques

To optimize the performance of these algorithms, the following techniques are employed:

*   **Cache Management**: Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce unnecessary computations and improve overall system responsiveness.
